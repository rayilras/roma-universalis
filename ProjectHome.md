Roma Universalis

Requires:
Europa Universalis IV

Inspired by Europa Universalis: Rome, Roma Universalis plunges the world of Europa Universalis back into Antiquity. Command a Greek city-state, Successor Kingdom, or the young Roman Republic in a bid to dominate all of Europa. The game begins in 474 AVC (274 BC); the Pyrrhic War rages on in Italy, the Wars of the Successor Kingdoms have wind down to an end, and Carthage controls much of the trade in the West. Who is to command Europa?
