 RISE_OF_ROME: "Pyrrhic War"
 RISE_OF_ROME_DESC: "The Pyrrhic War initially started as a minor conflict between Rome and the city of Tarentum over a naval treaty violation by one of the Roman consuls. At the time Tarentum was still the foremost among the Greek colonies in southern Italy, collectively known as Magna Graecia. The city had previously aided the Greek ruler Pyrrhus of Epirus in his conflict with Corcyra and requested military aid from Epirus against Rome. Pyrrhus honored his obligation, landing in southern Italy with his army. The war lasted for five years and proved that the Greek states were incapable of protecting Magna Graecia from Roman expansion."
